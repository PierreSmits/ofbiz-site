                <p>All the bugs that we know about are recorded in our JIRA issue tracking system. Before creating a new issue, please check that the same bug hasn't already been reported. If it hasn't been reported then please create a new Jira issue. It is very important that you include as much detail as possible so that someone else can reproduce the bug easily.

                <div class="divider"><span></span></div>
                <p>As an open source project, we take the legality of code seriously and we don't want people contributing code that they don't own or a 3rd party having a legal claim on our project. This is why we ask all our contributors to complete an Individual Contributor Licence Agreement (ICLA)</p>
		<p>If you are interested in contributing code then you can submit patches to the project via Jira. Create a new issue that describes what the code you are contributing does, and submit a .patch file with your code changes. Your patch will be reviewed and if it meets the project standard then it will be integrated into our codebase</p>
                <p>Bugs happen and you might see one and know how to fix it. If it is an existing bug already reported in our JIRA system then please feel free to upload your patch. If it is a new bug, then create a new issue as mentioned above.</p>

                <p>If you are ready to help us document code, provide tips and trick or anything else that is not coding, then we have a WIKI that allows community contributions. Simply let us know on the user@ofbiz.apache.org mailing list that you want to become a contributor. Note that you will need to complete an Individual Contributor Licence Agreement (ICLA) beforehand.</p>
